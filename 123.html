C Increment and Decrement Operators

C programming has two operators increment ++ and decrement -- to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment ++ increases the value by 1 whereas decrement -- decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.
Example 2: Increment and Decrement Operators

// Working of increment and decrement operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 10, b = 100;
    float c = 10.5, d = 100.5;

    printf("++a = %d \n", ++a);
    printf("--b = %d \n", --b);
    printf("++c = %f \n", ++c);
    printf("--d = %f \n", --d);

    return 0;
}

Output

++a = 11
--b = 99
++c = 11.500000
++d = 99.500000

C Assignment Operators

An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is =



			Operator
				Example
				Same as





			=
				a = b
				a = b



			+=
				a += b
				a = a+b



			-=
				a -= b
				a = a-b



			*=
				a *= b
				a = a*b



			/=
				a /= b
				a = a/b



			%=
				a %= b
				a = a%b



Example 3: Assignment Operators

// Working of assignment operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, c;

    c = a;      // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c += a;     // c is 10
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c -= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c *= a;     // c is 25
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c /= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c %= a;     // c = 0
    printf("c = %d\n", c);

    return 0;
}

Output

c = 5
c = 10
c = 5
c = 25
c = 5
c = 0

C Relational Operators

A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.



			Operator
				Meaning of Operator
				Example





			==
				Equal to
				5 == 3 is evaluated to 0



			>
				Greater than
				5 > 3 is evaluated to 1



			<
				Less than
				5 < 3 is evaluated to 0



			!=
				Not equal to
				5 != 3 is evaluated to 1



			>=
				Greater than or equal to
				5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1



			<=
				Less than or equal to
				5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0



Example 4: Relational Operators

// Working of relational operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10;

    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, c, a == c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, c, a < c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, c, a != c);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, c, a >= c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, c, a <= c);

    return 0;
}

Output

5 == 5 is 1
5 == 10 is 0
5 > 5 is 0
5 > 10 is 0
5 < 5 is 0
5 < 10 is 1
5 != 5 is 0
5 != 10 is 1
5 >= 5 is 1
5 >= 10 is 0
5 <= 5 is 1
5 <= 10 is 1

C Logical Operators

An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.



			Operator
				Meaning
				Example





			&&
				Logical AND. True only if all operands are true
				If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0.



			||
				Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true
				If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1.



			!
				Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0
				If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0.



Example 5: Logical Operators

// Working of logical operators

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10, result;

    result = (a == b) && (c > b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c > b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) && (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a != b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a != b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a != b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a == b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);

    return 0;
}

Output

(a == b) && (c > b) is 1
(a == b) && (c < b) is 0
(a == b) || (c < b) is 1
(a != b) || (c < b) is 0
!(a != b) is 1
!(a == b) is 0

C Bitwise Operators

During computation, mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.

Bitwise operators are used in C programming to perform bit-level operations.



			Operators
				Meaning of operators





			&
				Bitwise AND



			|
				Bitwise OR



			^
				Bitwise exclusive OR



			~
				Bitwise complement



			<<
				Shift left



			>>
				Shift right

Other Operators
Comma Operator

Comma operators are used to link related expressions together. For example:

int a, c = 5, d;

The sizeof operator

The sizeof is a unary operator that returns the size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc).
Example 6: sizeof Operator

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    char d;
    printf("Size of int=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(a));
    printf("Size of float=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(b));
    printf("Size of double=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of char=%lu byte\n",sizeof(d));

    return 0;
}

Output

Size of int = 4 bytes
Size of float = 4 bytes
Size of double = 8 bytes
Size of char = 1 byte
